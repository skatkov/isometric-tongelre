"""Traffic for the viewer: lanes along the OpenStreetMap roads and paths that little cars, cyclists and walkers use.

A lane runs one way along a stretch of road between two junctions, on the right-hand side: the BGT carriageways and
cycle paths show how wide the road really is and where it lies, since the OpenStreetMap line is seldom exactly in
the middle. Cars keep to the middle of their half, cyclists to its edge, walkers to the pavement when the BGT has one
next to the road, and to the edge of the road when it doesn't. Where a building or a tree
crown stands in front of the road on screen, the lane records a hidden stretch, so a car disappears behind it instead
of being drawn on the roof; under a tree crown it shows faintly, as if seen through the leaves. Roads that leave the map end in an exit: a car that drives out comes back in at another
exit of the same road class.

Output: data/build/traffic.json
